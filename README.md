# Greek_I_Dataset

Following S.M. Baugh's "A Greek Primer".

All the vocabulary with gloss matching the primer can be found in [all_vocab.tsv](https://github.com/mclee96/Greek_I_Dataset/blob/master/all_vocab.tsv).

Futher subdivisions of the vocabulary (by chapter or by part of speech) can be found in the folder [vocab_sets](https://github.com/mclee96/Greek_I_Dataset/tree/master/vocab_sets)

In addition, all New Testament occurences of vocabulary have been saved and organized by chapter in the folder [morphs](https://github.com/mclee96/Greek_I_Dataset/tree/master/morphs). Although words do not always appear in all their declensions/conjugations, by studying in sets you can generally ensure that you get adequate exposure to every form.

All the files are "Tab Separated Values" (.tsv), which means they can easily be copied and pasted into 
* Anki
* Quizlet
* Google Spreadsheets
* Microsoft Excel
